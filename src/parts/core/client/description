This asynchronous client-only facet awaits all other necessary facets before removing the "unhydrated" class from the body page and declaring the server- or worker-rendered DOM fully hydrated. The user cannot interact with the page until it is declared hydrated. Parts can use `client.promise.then(...)` to invoke a method the moment hydration is complete.
